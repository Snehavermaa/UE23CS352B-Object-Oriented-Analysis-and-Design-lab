# UE23CS352B – Object Oriented Analysis and Design Lab

This repository contains all **lab exercises, case studies, and design artifacts** created as part of the  
**UE23CS352B – Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Lab**.

The focus of this lab is to understand **how real-world problems are analyzed, modeled, and designed** using object-oriented principles and UML diagrams before implementation.

---

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- Understand Object-Oriented Analysis and Design concepts
- Perform requirement analysis using use cases
- Model systems using UML diagrams
- Apply object-oriented principles to system design
- Translate problem statements into structured designs
