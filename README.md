# UE23CS352B – Object Oriented Analysis and Design Lab

This repository contains all **lab exercises, case studies, and design artifacts** created as part of the  
**UE23CS352B – Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) Lab**.

The focus of this lab is to understand **how real-world problems are analyzed, modeled, and designed** using object-oriented principles and UML diagrams before implementation.

---

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- Understand Object-Oriented Analysis and Design concepts
- Perform requirement analysis using use cases
- Model systems using UML diagrams
- Apply object-oriented principles to system design
- Translate problem statements into structured designs

## 🔁 Typical Lab Workflow

1. Analyze the given problem statement  
2. Identify actors and system requirements  
3. Prepare use case diagrams  
4. Write detailed use case specifications  
5. Identify classes and objects  
6. Design UML diagrams  
7. Review and refine the design

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- UML Modeling Tools (StarUML / Draw.io / Visual Paradigm)
- PlantUML (where applicable)
- Documentation tools
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📝 Notes

- Each experiment includes:
  - Problem statement
  - Analysis
  - UML diagrams
  - Design explanation
- This repository focuses on **design and modeling**, not full code implementation.
